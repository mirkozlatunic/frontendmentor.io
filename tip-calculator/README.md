## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript for Responsive Styling

### What I learned

This project was an excellent opportunity to apply and solidify my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals. Building this tip calculator helped me grasp essential concepts like:

- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Working with form inputs and real-time calculations
- State management in vanilla JavaScript
- Conditional logic and error handling
- Number formatting and precision

It took me quite a while to fully understand how JavaScript functions work together in a real-world application. The concept of event listeners and how they trigger state changes that affect the UI was particularly challenging at first. I had to put in significant effort to understand how to properly structure my code and ensure that all calculations update correctly when any input changes.

Through persistent practice and debugging, I eventually developed a solid understanding of how to create interactive web applications with JavaScript. This project taught me the importance of writing clean, maintainable code and handling edge cases properly.

### Useful resources

- [JavaScript Rerendering](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/workshops/dom-rendering/) - The documentation showed me how to use the rerendering function for the card elements.
