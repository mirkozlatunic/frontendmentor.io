## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript for Responsive Styling

### What I learned

I have embraced this project to delve into the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has inspired me to eliminate code repetition and harness JavaScript to effectively manage click events. Through this journey, I have discovered how to render card elements in HTML seamlessly and with purpose. Also how to setup the weekly button as the default.

### Useful resources

- [JavaScript Rerendering](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/workshops/dom-rendering/) - The documentation showed me how to use the rerendering function for the card elements.
